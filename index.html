		//Body Mass Index (BMI) is a measure of healthy weight. It can be calculated by taking your weight in kilograms and dividing by the square of your height in meters. Write a program that prompts the user to enter a weight in pounds and a height in feet and inches and displays the user's BMI value. To convert the users weight in pounds to their weight in kilograms you will need to use the fact that there are 2.2 pounds in one kilogram.

		var weight = prompt("What is your weight in pounds?");
		weight = parseFloat(weight);
		var height = prompt("What is your height in inches?");
		height = parseFloat(height);
		var weightKg = weight * .45;
		var heightMeters = height * 0.0254;
		var bmi = weightKg / (heightMeters * heightMeters);
		console.log(weightKg);
		console.log(heightMeters);
		console.log(bmi);
		alert("Your BMI is " + bmi);

		//The temperature T in degrees Celsius (°C) is equal to the temperature T in degrees Fahrenheit (°F) minus 32, times 5/9. Write a program which asks the user the temperature in celsius and displays it in Fahrenheit.

		var temperatureCelsius = prompt("What is the temperature in celsius?");
		temperatureCelsius = parseFloat(temperatureCelsius);
		var temperatureFahrenheit = (temperatureCelsius * (9/5) + 32);
		console.log(temperatureFahrenheit);
		alert("The temperature in Fahrenheit is " + temperatureFahrenheit);

		//Create a program which prompts the user to enter five test scores. Then, output the average of the five test scores.

		var testOne = prompt("You'll be asked to enter 5 test scores. Enter the first one here:");
		var testTwo = prompt("Please enter a second test score:");
		var testThree = prompt("Please enter a third test score:");
		var testFour = prompt("Please enter a fourth test score:");
		var testFive = prompt("Please enter a fifth and final test score:");
		testOne = parseFloat(testOne);
		testTwo = parseFloat(testTwo);
		testThree = parseFloat(testThree);
		testFour = parseFloat(testFour);
		testFive = parseFloat(testFive);
		var scoreAverage = (testOne + testTwo + testThree + testFour + testFive) / 5;
		console.log(scoreAverage);
		alert("The average of these five test scores is " + scoreAverage);
